    <!-- Chosen Palette: Cool & Calm -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured into thematic sections to guide the user logically through the complex topic of financial ratio analysis. It starts with a foundational 'What is Ratio Analysis?' section, moves to an interactive 'Key Ratio Categories' explorer, provides concrete examples with 'Case Studies', discusses limitations and advanced topics in 'Critiques and Predictive Models', and concludes with 'Key Takeaways'. This narrative flow was chosen to build knowledge progressively, from basic definitions to practical application and critical evaluation, making the dense report content more digestible and engaging for users ranging from students to professionals. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Key Ratios (Inform/Compare): Used interactive cards and a detail pane. This allows users to explore different ratios at their own pace. Goal: Compare ratio types. Method: HTML/CSS cards + JS for dynamic content display. Interaction: Click to view details. Justification: More engaging than a static list and allows for focused learning.
        - Case Study Data (Change/Compare): Used Chart.js Bar and Line charts to visualize financial trends over time for KRIBHCO and PT. Mayora. Goal: Show change over time and compare yearly performance. Viz: Bar Chart for direct comparison (e.g., Working Capital), Line Chart for trend analysis (e.g., Net Profit). Interaction: Chart tooltips provide specific data points. Justification: Visual charts are far more effective at showing trends and comparing values than raw data tables from the source reports.
        - Predictive Models (Organize): A structured HTML/CSS flow diagram was used for Altman Z-Score. Goal: Show a process/formula. Method: Styled divs and flexbox. Interaction: Static visual aid. Justification: A visual flow makes the multi-step formula easier to understand than a block of text.
        - NO SVG/Mermaid used. All visuals are pure HTML/CSS or rendered on HTML Canvas by Chart.js.

                        Financial ratio analysis is a cornerstone of financial statement analysis. It involves calculating various financial metrics (ratios) to gain insights into a company's performance, efficiency, and financial stability. By comparing these ratios to historical data, industry benchmarks, and competitors, analysts, investors, and managers can make more informed decisions. The process serves as a diagnostic tool, highlighting strengths and weaknesses that might not be apparent from looking at raw financial statements alone.

                    <p>
                        This analytical method transforms vast amounts of accounting data into standardized, comparable metrics. It's a quantitative process that helps in evaluating various aspects of a company's operations, including its liquidity (ability to meet short-term debts), profitability (ability to generate income), leverage (reliance on debt), and efficiency (how well it uses its assets). Ultimately, ratio analysis provides a deeper, more nuanced understanding of a firm's financial narrative.

                     <p>Financial ratio analysis is an indispensable tool for deciphering the complex financial health of a company. While it does not provide all the answers, it directs analysts to the right questions. The synthesis of various studies shows that no single ratio can tell the whole story. Instead, a holistic approach, combining liquidity, profitability, leverage, and activity ratios, is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation. As demonstrated in the case studies, ratios can effectively pinpoint areas of strength, like PT. Mayora Indah's strong liquidity, and areas of concern, such as the gap between gross and net profit at KRIBHCO.</p>
                    <p>
                        For stakeholders, from investors to managers, the key is to use ratio analysis not as a mechanical exercise but as an investigative tool. It should be combined with qualitative factors, industry context, and economic conditions to form a well-rounded judgment. The enduring relevance of this technique, from early 20th-century credit assessments to modern bankruptcy prediction models, underscores its fundamental importance in the world of finance.
